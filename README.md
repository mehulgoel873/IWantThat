# I Want That

I Want That is a Gemini AI-based iOS app that allows users to upload photos or text describing an art piece, and find artists that can create said pieces. This innovative app will help users bring their visions to life. 

## Installation
If you are looking to install this app on any iOS device, versions 12 and above, follow the instructions below:

1. Install this app through Test Flight, an iOS beta app tester, using this link: https://testflight.apple.com/join/hWj7mdZA

As of August 12th, the public app store release has not been created, but if so, this readme will be updated and users can publicly access I Want That on the app store.

## Technology

I Want That makes heavy use of the Gemini LLM to perform image recognition and captioning in order to "understand" what the user wants and create a successful app based upon that. 

It also uses flutter and firebase to create a universal app that involves a no SQL solution.
